# Maya GeometryWalker

A native implementation of Olygraph's geometry walker to transfer vertex position of one mesh to another with different mesh topology. Works with any Maya version since it's not QT dependent.

## Usage

- Put the geometryWalker folder in `<username>\Documents\maya\scripts`
- Run with

```python
import geometryWalker
geometryWalker.create()
```
